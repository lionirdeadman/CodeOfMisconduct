## Code of Misconduct 1.1.1

### Definitions

Development process : Project management platform actions (Issues, pull requests, commits) and official discussions for development (IRC, Mailing list, etc.).

### Standards

If a user involved in {THE SOFTWARE} becomes a nuisance to the project during any part of the development process, we may remove their right to participate in the development of {THE SOFTWARE} within the project.

### Scope

We believe only the communication during development processes matters. Any broader scope would mean a violation of their personal space and freedom of opinion.

### Justification

Code has the same function regardless of the people who are making it. Judgment of someone's ethics will always result in the project being politically-involved and we want to avoid this.
